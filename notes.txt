// BUILDING OBSERVED NETWORK

for each log file:
  for each log entry:
    validate entry format and throw exception on error
    for each trait:
      count unique traits

create cluster set (size from count of unique traits)

for each log file:
  for each log entry:
    connect clusters for each trait if they pass the evidence threshold*
    create list of cluster-logs (cluster-log = List<Pair<timestamp, cluster id>>)

*evidence threshold = seen together in at least X log entries by at least Y users

create graph (size from count of remaining clusters)

for each cluster-log:
  for each Pair<timestamp, cluster id>:
    if contiguous, disparate clusters were seen within threshold, form a connection between them

// MATCHING TO IDEAL NETWORK

// TEST NETWORK

26 nodes A-Z on graph, each labelled by up to 30 different traits (780 unique traits)
